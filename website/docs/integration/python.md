# Python

For Python projects, **git-cliff** can be configured in `pyproject.toml` via the [tool table](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/#tool-table). To do this, simply replace the available configuration sections with `[tool.git-cliff.<section>]` and place them inside `pyproject.toml`. For example:

```toml
name = "..."

[project]
dependencies = []

[tool.git-cliff.changelog]
header = "All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file."
body_template = "..."
footer_template = "<!-- generated by git-cliff -->"
exclude_ungrouped_changes = false
# see [changelog] section for more keys

[tool.git-cliff.commit]
parse_conventional_commits = true
commit_parsers = []
# see [commit] section for more keys
```
